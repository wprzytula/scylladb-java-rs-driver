/**
 * Default {@link DriverConfigReporter}: serializes the driver configuration to the cross-driver
 * {@code DRIVER_CONFIG} JSON shape and adds it to the control connection's {@code STARTUP} options.
 *
 * <p><b>The rule this class is built on: report the object that is in force, not the configuration
 * it was built from.</b> The blob is (re)built on demand every time the control connection
 * initializes, so a group whose option is re-read on every use reads the current (possibly
 * reloaded) {@link DriverExecutionProfile} here too. But a policy or factory that captures an
 * option once — into a {@code final} field in its constructor, or at {@code init()} — keeps using
 * that value for the life of the session, because the context holds every one of them in a
 * once-built {@code LazyReference}. For those the profile is the wrong source: after a reload it
 * carries values no request executes with, and {@code advanced.speculative-execution-policy} is
 * documented as not modifiable at runtime outright. So they are read off the running instance —
 * {@code connection.reconnection.policy}, {@code query.speculative-execution.policy}, {@code
 * query.load-balancing.policy.adaptive-ordering}, the first term of {@code
 * fallback-to-non-preferred-nodes}, both {@code node-preference} groups, and {@code
 * connection.tls.hostname-verification} off the active handler factory rather than the configured
 * engine factory.
 *
 * <p>Anything added here owes the same question: find what consumes the option, and if it stores
 * the value rather than re-reading it, expose an accessor and read that. Every field that got this
 * wrong reported a plausible value that no traffic was subject to, which is the one failure mode a
 * diagnostic cannot afford.
 *
 * <p>No profile read can cost more than the field it describes. {@code reference.conf} ships inside
 * the driver jar and {@code OptionsMap.driverDefaults()} fills every option this class touches, so
 * a missing one takes a config source that supplies neither — but the no-fallback getters throw
 * when an option is absent, and one throw here used to drop the whole report behind a single
 * warning. So every read is either guarded by {@link DriverExecutionProfile#isDefined} or passes an
 * explicit fallback, chosen by what the schema permits: where the field or its group is
 * <em>optional</em>, the fallback is the same "disabled" sentinel that already omits it (an
 * undefined page size reads as unbounded, an undefined timeout as off), and where the field is
 * <em>required</em> the fallback is the value {@code reference.conf} documents, since dropping it
 * would make the whole document invalid. Two of the required ones cannot be reached in practice:
 * {@code ChannelFactory} reads {@code max-requests-per-connection} while building the channel and
 * the built-in load balancing policies resolve {@code basic.request.consistency} in their
 * constructor, so a session missing either never gets far enough to report anything.
 *
 * <p>Follows the schema's omission principle throughout: a key the Java driver has no equivalent
 * for is left out of the JSON entirely rather than reported as {@code null}. The same applies where
 * a configured value falls outside what the schema can express but the key is <em>optional</em>: a
 * disabled request timeout, a disabled {@code SO_LINGER}, an unbounded page size, a {@code
 * basic.request.serial-consistency} outside the schema's two serial levels and the like are omitted
 * rather than emitted as a value the schema rejects. Two optional booleans are omitted for a third
 * reason — the answer is genuinely unknown, which is the only thing the schema lets their absence
 * mean: {@code connection.tls.hostname-verification} when the SSL handler or engine factory in
 * force is not one this class recognizes, and {@code query.defaults.client-timestamps} when the
 * timestamp generator is not (see {@link #hostnameValidation} and {@link #clientTimestamps}).
 * Guessing a boolean there would describe a security control, or a write-timestamp source, that may
 * well be the opposite — which is also why neither is asked of the SPI itself: an accessor on
 * {@link SslEngineFactory} or {@link TimestampGenerator} would have needed a default, and a default
 * answer is exactly the guess being avoided.
 *
 * <p><b>A new field owes three checks</b>, each of which this class has already got wrong once and
 * each of which is cheap to run before review does it for you:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Source.</b> The rule above — is the value re-read on every use, or captured once?
 *   <li><b>Range.</b> Every value the option legally accepts must land inside the schema's
 *       constraint or take the omission route: a disabled or zero setting, a negative one, a
 *       sub-millisecond duration against a field counting whole milliseconds, and the option being
 *       undefined altogether. Note the driver's units and the schema's need not agree — {@code
 *       max-executions} counts the initial execution and the schema does not — so compare the two
 *       definitions rather than the two names, and pin each boundary with a test.
 *   <li><b>Warrant.</b> Do not assert a property the implementation does not guarantee. The line
 *       this class draws: nothing is <em>inferred</em> on a third party's behalf — no {@code
 *       dc-auto} for a policy the SPI never obliged to work one out, no guessed boolean for a
 *       component this class does not recognize — but what the operator explicitly
 *       <em>configured</em> is passed through even where the component in force may ignore it,
 *       because hiding a real setting is the worse failure. Where that line lands is a judgement
 *       call; say which side and why.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Known limitation:</b> that omission is not always available. Two <em>required</em> fields
 * are constrained slightly more tightly than the driver option behind them, so a configured value
 * can in principle fall outside what the schema admits. Only the first is reachable through a live
 * session:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code query.defaults.consistency} is a closed enum of the levels the schema knows, while
 *       {@code basic.request.consistency} is an unvalidated string. A name outside that enum fails
 *       the session as long as the load balancing policy is a built-in one, since those resolve it
 *       through the {@code ConsistencyLevelRegistry} in their constructor — so reaching this needs
 *       a custom registry that defines extra names, or a custom policy that never resolves the
 *       default (see {@link #queryDefaults}). Its optional sibling {@code
 *       query.defaults.serial-consistency} has the same mismatch and is <em>not</em> in this list,
 *       precisely because being optional lets it take the omission route instead.
 *   <li>{@code connection.requests.in-flight.max} must be strictly positive, and nothing validates
 *       {@code advanced.connection.max-requests-per-connection} against that: {@code
 *       ChannelFactory} hands the configured value straight to {@code StreamIdGenerator}, which
 *       does not range-check it (see {@link #requests}). No live session can report such a value
 *       all the same, because it is the connection that fails first: a negative setting makes
 *       {@code StreamIdGenerator}'s {@code BitSet} throw while the channel is still being built,
 *       and zero leaves no stream id for the control connection's own {@code OPTIONS} — {@code
 *       ChannelHandlerRequest} fails it on {@code preAcquireId} before this class is ever asked for
 *       a report. So the mismatch is unreachable by construction rather than a live exposure; the
 *       value is nonetheless reported as configured, and pinned by a test, so that the behavior is
 *       defined if the driver ever stops failing that early. The same setting would also drive
 *       {@code connection.requests.orphaned.max} negative (see {@code
 *       ChannelFactory#effectiveMaxOrphanRequests}), which is the second reason not to read this as
 *       one field's gap.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both values are reported <em>as-is</em>. The reporter deliberately neither fabricates an
 * admissible value — which would misreport a setting an operator may have chosen on purpose — nor
 * drops the whole report over one field, so such a document is accurate but fails schema
 * validation. For the consistency level, that is a cross-driver schema gap: the fix is to let the
 * field express the value, the way {@code control-plane.schema.agreement.timeout-ms} already admits
 * 0, the constant policy delays do, and {@code query.defaults.request} now does by being optional.
 *
 * <p>Where a duration <em>is</em> reported, any strictly positive value reports as at least
 * 1&nbsp;millisecond (see {@link #positiveMillis}), so a sub-millisecond timeout that is live at
 * runtime is never reported as the 0 that means "disabled". Three fields are deliberately exempt,
 * because 0 is what they really mean there: {@code connection.connect.timeout-ms} (Netty's {@code
 * CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS} takes the truncated millisecond value, where 0 disables the timeout),
 * {@code control-plane.queries.system.timeout.server-side-ms} (its value goes on the wire as the
 * millisecond argument of a {@code USING TIMEOUT} clause, so a sub-millisecond setting really is
 * {@code 0ms} server-side), and {@code query.speculative-execution.policy.delay-ms} (which is the
 * policy's own already-truncated millisecond count, and whose {@code reference.conf} documents
 * delays below 1 millisecond as equivalent to 0).
 *
 * <p><b>Known limitation:</b> the report always describes {@link
 * com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.config.DriverExecutionProfile#DEFAULT_NAME the default execution
 * profile}, not whichever profile a given request actually runs with. A session that relies on
 * named execution profiles for some of its traffic will have that traffic's real settings
 * (consistency level, timeouts, retry policy, ...) differ from what {@code DRIVER_CONFIG} reports.
 * Reporting per-profile configuration would need a schema shape for multiple profiles, which the
 * cross-driver schema doesn't define; this is a known gap, not an oversight.
 *
 * <p><b>Thread safety:</b> this class is safe to use as shipped, and holds no mutable state. Note
 * that {@code buildJson()} runs on every control-connection (re)initialization, and may be called
 * concurrently with a reconnect racing a fresh session start.

   * and a policy that is not one of the built-ins {@linkplain #infersLocalDatacenter known to work
   * one out}. {@code dc-auto} is a claim that a datacenter <em>will</em> be settled on, and neither
   * {@code BasicLoadBalancingPolicy} (datacenter-agnostic for the life of the session) nor an
   * arbitrary custom policy (the SPI requires no inference at all) makes that claim good.

   * <p>An <em>explicitly configured</em> datacenter, on the other hand, is reported whatever the
   * policy is — and that is an approximation for a custom one. Both parents describe an effect the
   * built-ins produce: {@link #connection} claims the datacenter scopes which nodes hold a pool
   * (true only because {@code BasicLoadBalancingPolicy#computeNodeDistance} makes an out-of-DC node
   * {@code IGNORED}), and {@link #query} claims it scopes routing. A custom {@link

   * honor neither. Reported all the same, deliberately, on the grounds that hiding a setting the
   * operator really did make is the worse failure mode — the same call as reporting a configured
   * rack for a policy that ignores it. Note the asymmetry with the paragraph above: nothing is
   * <em>inferred</em> on a custom policy's behalf, but what was configured is passed through.
   *
   * <p>A configured {@code basic.load-balancing-policy.evaluator.class} weakens the same claim one
   * step further, even for a built-in policy: {@code BasicLoadBalancingPolicy#computeNodeDistance}
   * consults the evaluator before the datacenter, so it can make an in-DC node {@code IGNORED} and
